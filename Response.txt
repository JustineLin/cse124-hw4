= Homework 4: Mid-course survey

My goal is to be an effective instructor.  Please fill out an anonymous
survey to help me achieve that goal.  I do not collect your username, GMail
address, or other personally identifying information.  The only information
recorded are your answers to these questions as well as the date and time the
form was filled out.

Because your information is not attached to the survey form, I'm asking
you to indicate below that you've filled out the form (on the honor
system).  To indicate that you did that, change the "NO" to a "YES"
and submit this homework the same way you submitted HWs 1, 2, and 3.

The survey form is located at:
